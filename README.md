### The repository contains the following materials:

- Project proposal
- Paper in PDF format
- Complete project code
- Video presentation

This is a compilation of materials for my first project in the course DSC 680 (Applied Data Science) at Bellevue University. This project aims to build a machine learning model that has the capability to predict, with great accuracy, when a credit card transaction presents as being fraudulent. Beginning with exploratory data analysis, I use machine learning algorithms to understand and work through these data. By exploring the data set and understanding trends, I build and train a model to predict which transactions are fraudulent, ultimately aiming to test and select the most accurate model for this set of data.
